# Forensic Geo IP Traffic Analyser
Forensic tool to geo locate the traffic from a packet capture (.pcap) file for kali linux or any other linux distro

This tool locates the zone and co-ordinates of the ip traffic flowing through your network.
This is just an initial build, I will try to add vpn capture hopefully in the future.

in kali terminal

git clone 
cd 
chmod +x install.sh 
./install.sh

done!!
